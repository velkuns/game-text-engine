# Data - Statuses

## Status

`draft`

## Context

To have more complex game mechanics, we can have skills, blessings, curses, physical or magical states that can have
an impact on player (abilities or not).
For example:
- blindness (state) that decrease some abilities related to perception
- a skill that increase the combat abilities
- a benediction that increase the vitality
- a curse that decrease the strength
- ...

List of possible status types:
- skill
- state
- blessing
- curse
- title (purely descriptive, no effect)
